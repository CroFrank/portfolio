In this portfolio you'll read my short story of getting into web development.<br />
I showcase skills and projects I worked on.<br />
Inside you can find contact info to get to me and also download my CV.

## ðŸš€ In this project I used:

- Astro as generator and framework
- JS - programming language
- TS - superset of JS
- React - Ui js library
- Tailwind for styling

## ðŸ§ž Commands

If you want to get it locally on your machine:<br />
All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
